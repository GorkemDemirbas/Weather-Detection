# Weather-Detection
Weather Detection and Warning System Project by using STM32F4 Nucleo Series Microcontroller Board. In this project, There is a system that detects the current weather condition by using LM35 Temperature sensor and gives a warning at the exit using a passive buzzer, Led (Red, Green, Blue) and 16x2 LCD screen, and warnings were changed according to different weather conditions.Such as, normal,hot, cold and etc. This project was made by using STM32CubeIde. The codes were written in C programming language. Also ready-to-use libraries were used in this project.
