# Weather-Detection
It is a project named as "Weather Detection and Warning System". In this project STM32F4 Nucleo Series Microcontroller Board was used. It is a system that detects the instant weather condition by using LM35 Temperature sensor and gives a warning at the output using a passive buzzer, Led (Red, Green, Blue) and 16x2 LCD screen, warnings were changed according to different weather conditions.Such as, normal, hot, cold and etc. This project was made by using STM32CubeIde. The codes were written in C programming language. Ready-to-use libraries were used in this project.
